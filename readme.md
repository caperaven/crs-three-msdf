# CRS MSDF

IN PROGRESS

## Introduction

This package borrows from three-bmfont-text located at https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text.  
I only wanted the msdf code, and I wanted to clean it up in order to work with native es6 modules and with fewer dependencies.

three-bmfont-text also has depreciated dependencies that should be avoided.  
Fortunately all the sub dependencies are all MIT based, so you will find files in this library with those dependencies also refactored in ES6.  

This library is fully self-contained then and does not have any external dependencies.
